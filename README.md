# Natural-Language-Understanding
A small study assingment using LUIS

For my degree programm I needed to an natual language understanding app in which you can add your blood sugar, your weight and your 
blood pressure. It is connected with the LUIS server from Microsoft. I used Node.js. 
I was able to use the disciption and the code from our university teacher.
